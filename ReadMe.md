# Demo Project - Mini Tweet

I will go through a demo project, Mini Tweet, from the scratch, to give you a clearer picture and better idea of how to build a web application, both backend and frontend. If you are new to web development, this demo project will be a good start for you and you can follow my suggestions to finish your final projects. Otherwise, you can follow your own way to build your final projects.

# Final Project

There are two final projects. You have to finish them all to pass the training.

You will be asked to make teams to conquer these two projects. The group size is 2-3 people. You can choose your own group members. If you don't have any group members eventually, TA will help you find a group.
